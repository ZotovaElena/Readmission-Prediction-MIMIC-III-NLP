       "\"Admission Date:  [**2110-12-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2110-12-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2061-12-15**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48 year old male with a history of hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular cancer status post chemoembo in [**5-6**] who presented to [**Hospital3 4298**] E.D. on [**2110-12-7**] with hematemesis since [**2110-12-5**].  He had one episode of hematemesis on [**12-5**]/ and two episodes on [**12-6**] as well as hematemesis and hematochezia on [**12-7**].  At [**Hospital3 4298**] E.D. patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 18 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and was noted to be having coagulopathy with INR of 2.1 and was given FFP as well as vitamin K.  Patient denies any past history of varices or upper GI bleed.  He denies recent alcohol or drug use.  He was feeling nauseated and began vomiting and continued to have hematemesis for three days until he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.  Patient was transfused a total of five units of packed red blood cells and was given vitamin K to counteract his coagulopathy.  He underwent EGD on [**2110-12-8**] and was banded with sclerotherapy for grade 3 lower esophageal varices in both the lower and mid-esophagus.  Patient also had an abdominal CT on [**2110-12-4**] for followup of chemoembo which showed portal vein thrombosis.  At present patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting. No fever, or chills.  He states he feels much better now.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hepatitis C virus and alcoholic cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2101**].  Duodenal ulcer status post perforation with repair in [**2101**].  He was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in [**5-6**].  He had radiotherapy as well as chemoembolization therapy.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  MEDICATIONS:  Aldactone 50 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg q.o.d., Percocet, Dilaudid, Zantac, OxyContin.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a smoker and a former drinker.  Denies drug use.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission patient had blood pressure of 130/90, heart rate 99, temperature 99.3, sating 100% in room air.  Generally, he was slightly drowsy and jaundiced in mild distress.  HEENT was normocephalic, atraumatic, slightly icteric.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  No JVD.  Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left base.  Lungs were clear to auscultation with minimal rales at the left base.  Abdomen was distended with mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant, no guarding, no rebound as well as a well healed midline scar.  Extremities revealed trace pedal edema bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis.  Skin exam revealed diffuse spider angioma.  No caput medusae.  Neuro he was awake, alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves were intact grossly.  He had no focal deficits.  He had minimal asterixis in the left hand upon presentation, however, it resolved upon admission to [**Hospital1 1444**].  LABORATORY DATA:  Patient labs at [**Hospital3 4298**] revealed hematocrit of 18, white count 21.5, platelets 321.  Chem-7 was unremarkable.  LFTs revealed AST of 205, ALT 108, alka phos 208, t-bili 2.8, direct bili 1.9, indirect bili 0.9.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] and was admitted to the intensive care unit for EGD therapy.  1.  Upper GI bleed.  Patient underwent esophagogastroduodenostomy per GI service.  It was noted that he had grade 3 esophageal varices in the lower third of the esophagus.  He underwent sclerotherapy as well as banding. Patient was started on octreotide for continuation of a five day course status post EGD.  Patient was transfused a total of five units of packed red blood cells and was given vitamin K to correct FFP.  Patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout the hospitalization after banding and octreotide therapy.  Patient had no new episodes of hematemesis nor hematochezia during his hospitalization.  Patient became guaiac negative after two days of passing darkened clots in his stool.  2.  Abdominal distension.  Patient underwent unguided paracentesis with withdrawal of approximately 40 cc of transudative fluid with no cells and cultures were negative. Patient subsequently was ordered for an ultrasound guided paracentesis which revealed trace fluid, no tappable fluid. It was significant, however, for thickened bowel wall secondary to edematous changes from fluid overload.  Patient was to be diuresed with Aldactone and Lasix to remove the excess fluid in the abdominal wall as well as the intestinal wall.  3.  Low grade fever.  Patient had blood cultures drawn times six which were all negative for bacteremia.  Patient also had chest x-ray which was negative for infiltrate.  There was no source found for patient's low grade fever.  It is possible that patient has low grade fever secondary to his hepatocellular carcinoma status post chemoembolization. Patient remained nontoxic appearing throughout his hospitalization and no focus or nidus of infection was found to explain patient's intermittent low grade fever.  4.  Mild hypocalcemia and hyponatremia.  Patient was noted to be hyponatremic to a nadir of 130.  It was felt to be hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to the low urine sodium and obvious increase in total body water.  Patient was diuresed and improved with diuresis and sodium corrected without further intervention.  It was also noted that patient was mildly hypocalcemic with corrected calcium of 7.8. Patient received p.o. calcium supplementation.  Hypocalcemia was most likely secondary to diuresis as well as hepatic failure secondary to hep C cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma.  5.  Hepatocellular carcinoma status post chemoembolization. Patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in-house for question of possible further chemoembolization.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] stated that patient was no longer a candidate for chemoembolization, however, he was a possible candidate for oral chemotherapy. Patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one to two weeks status post discharge.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable for discharge.  DISCHARGE DESTINATION:  Home.  Patient is to be taken home by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] back to his home in [**Location (un) 3844**].  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Upper GI bleed secondary to varices status post sclerotherapy as well as band ligation. 2.  Blood loss anemia. 3.  Hepatocellular carcinoma. 4.  Hepatitis C virus. 5.  Right upper extremity superficial thrombophlebitis. 6.  Hyponatremia, hypocalcemia. 7.  Ascites. 8.  Pleural vein thrombosis. 9.  Alcoholic cirrhosis.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
