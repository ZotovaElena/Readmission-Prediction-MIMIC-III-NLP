She has had 10 episodes of vomiting and 10 episodes of diarrhea per day. She also has abdominal pain that feels like pressure and bloating, that is in a band-like area across the middle of her abdomen. She presented to the ED today because she was speaking with her daughter and said she was so tired that she couldn't even hold the phone any longer, that she was very dizzy, and that she just did not feel well. She had been keeping her black vomit and diarrhea a secret from the family. She has never had such black vomit or diarrhea before in her life.  Her granddaughter reports that she takes daily aspirin and frequently takes medications that she believes are in the same family as ibuprofen and aleve although they are sent from [**Country 3594**]. . In the ED, HR 110s with SBP 140s, moderately tender abdomen and melenic stools. NG lavage was clear, but was placed on high suction and began to show light pink fluid which may have been NGT trauma. Hct 19 down from Hct 33 on 9 days ago, but has antibodies to transfusions, so she is difficult to match. Received PPI IV in ED. .

DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.       Reference Range:  Negative. URINE CX [**2-19**]: NO GROWTH H PYLORI: POSITIVE . EGD: Presbyesophagus Abnormal mucosa in the stomach (gastritis) Duodenal ulcer Duodenal ulcer (ligation)  Brief Hospital Course: 87 F with anemia, GERD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, admitted with UGIB. . # Acute blood loss anemia:  Initial hct was found to be 21.1. She was transfused 2U prbcs and hct bumped from 21-->23-->24.8. GI was consulted and an upper endoscopy was performed in the intensive care unit.  The EGD revealed gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and small duodenal bleeding vessel which was clipped. Post procedure she received 2U prbcs total for a goal of hct 28 and hct remained stable.  Her hemodynamics were also stable.  H. pylori serology was positive and patient was started on treatment regimen (clarithro, flagyl, and protonix).  The patient has longstanding microcytic anemia and was scheduled for both colonoscopy and EGD as an outpatient.  Although anemia may be a result of occult UGI bleed, she should still undergo outpatient colonoscopy for screening purposes.  Her granddaughter states that patient takes aspirin regularly at home and other medications sent from [**Country 3594**] that she thought might be in the same family as NSAIDs.  She was instructed to avoid such medications in this setting.  Given ferritin 6.8, she was discharged home on an iron supplement for iron deficiency anemia. . # Iron deficiency anemia: Prior to this admission, her iron was 53 in [**12-6**] with ferritin 15.  During this hospital stay, her ferritin was again found to be very low at 6.8, consistent with iron deficiency anemia.  B12 and folate were normal.  This is likely secondary to occult GI bleed.  She had previously been scheduled for colonoscopy/EGD at the end of [**2167**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] but missed her appointment.  She will need colonoscopy for further screening upon discharge.  She will be discharged on iron supplementation. . # Diarrhea:  [**Name (NI) **] granddaughter reports diarrhea and nausea x nearly 10 days (although pt. states for approx. 3 days only). She reports no recent travel, no sick contacts, no recent hospitalizations nor antibiotics.  She has mild abdominal discomfort, but no focal abdominal findings.  3 day duration c/w gastroenteritis while 10 day duration seems long for persistent symptoms as she is having.  Does not have elevated WBC count, but had low grade temperature on admission which resolved. Possibly this was due to cathartic effect of GI bleeding.  Stool culture, including c diff negative. . # Right foot cellulitis:  Patient complained of pain and was noted to have swelling and erythema overlying the dorsum of her right foot.  No joint involvement and uric acid normal.  XRay negative for fracture.  Symptoms improved on clarithromycin with elevation/ACE wrap.  No skin tears, foot ulcer, and toenails intact.  She will follow-up with her PCP for continued monitoring. . # Left knee osteoarthritis:  Patient complained of left knee pain, relieved with standing tylenol.  XRay negative for fracture or dislocation.  She has known osteoarthritis and will follow-up with her PCP for this problem. . # DM2:  Her most recent HgbA1C was found to be 8.  HgbA1c this admission 6.9%.  She had significant glucosuria on admission UA.  Blood sugars were 140s-190s on ISS while in ICU.  She will be discharged on her oral agents (glipizide and roziglitazone), but will need close follow up given her elevated HgbA1C and inadequately controlled BS.  Of note, she reports that she has been taking her glipizide every other day but has tolerated daily dosing in house. . # Hypertension: Patient recently increased from 50 to 75 mg atenolol in 11/[**2167**]. She was tachycardic on admission, likely physiologic in setting of GIB, which improved slightly with fluid resuscitation.  Her home dose atenolol and imdur were originally held in the setting of her GI bleed, but her hemodynamics remained stable and SBPs were 110s-150s following EGD.  Her antihypertensives have since been restarted and her blood pressure remains under good control. . # hypercholesterolemia: She was continued on her home dose statin. . # COMM: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13118**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13119**], daughter, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13120**]   Medications on Admission: atenolol 75 mg QD glipizide 10 mg QD Rosiglitazone 8 mg QD Imdur 30 mg QD lovastatin 40 mg QD omeprazole 20 mg QD NTG prn   Discharge Medications: 1.

Please take the iron supplement, as prescribed. 4. You can take tylenol, as needed, for the pain in your knee. Please do not exceed more than 2 g total per day. 5. You should be taking calcium 3 times per day and vitamin D two times per day for your low bone density. 6. Please avoid any further use of aspirin, ibuprofen, motrin, alleve, or other similar medications.  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2168-3-3**] at 2:30 PM for recheck of your blood count, to schedule an outpatient colonoscopy for cancer screening, for continued management of your diabetes, and to discuss bone density testing.
